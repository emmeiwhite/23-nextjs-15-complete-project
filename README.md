# NextJS

NextJS is a React and NodeJS full stack framework

## React Server Components Architecture

RSC architecture is the new approach to creating React Components by dividing them into two distinct types:

- Server Components : By Default NextJS treats all components as Server Components
- Client Components : We need to use 'use client' directive to make define a client component

There are no hooks in Server Components and no interactively is allowed.
Client Components can be seen as normal React Components with interactivity, hooks etc

## Routing

Next.JS has file-based routing system
